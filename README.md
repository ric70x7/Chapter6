# Chapter6

The directory Figs contains the images shown in the paper.
These images were produced with the file sincos1 in the directory Code. Each function saves the image with the name they have in Figs/ that will help to make the match.

There the other files in code were used for the application to the malaria cases. I'm not sure if there is anything useful for you, maybe the quadrant diagram.

The in Figs/gifs, the file Kabarole.gif contains an animation that explains how the monitor system is intended to be read.

That code calls the content of the directory GCode, the only thing I found that was related to it was the file spde.py
